# Cannibal Carnival

Game Jam for ML_MSCH_C220 at Indiana University, created December 1st, 2022

## Theme

We wanted to twist the theme and take it a bit more literally in a twisted way, by using cannabalism instead of regular food.

## Game Play

Using the moving keys, find six different NPCs. Then, answer the question to get a bodypart.

## Impediments

The main challenge was coming up with creative ideas based on the main theme.

Also, we were surprised to spend so much time on how many details went into making the graphics for a game.

## Implementation

Design the Map, Items, NPC, and Main Character by self.

Built using [Godot 3.5](https://godotengine.org/download)
